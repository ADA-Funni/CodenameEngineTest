# Friday Night Funkin' - Codename Engine (WIP)
## Taking a break

If you're wondering why Codename source is already public, i'm simply taking a break. I don't know how long it'll be, but i'm for sure taking one.

The FNF community is hell, i'm tired of everyone asking me for early access or builds, i'm tired of people constantly bringing up Yoshi Engine along with it even through is dead, i just need a goddamn break.

I'll keep yall updated if this ever comes back into development, i just need some time for myself.

The repo was made public so that you can see whats already been done. I know its not that much, but i prefer to do that way to prevent more people from coming up in my dms and spamming me with "can i be a tester for codename" or whatever.

## PLEASE NOTE - THIS IS STILL IN AN ALPHA STATE

Early alpha of Codename Engine, known issues:
- Only the "introMod" folder works (no mod switching yet)
	- Also works with "introMod.zip"
- Titlescreen is broken (xml not implemented yet)
- Some options are missing
- Week 5 has no monster animation
- Week 6 still have no dialogue
- Week 7 have no running tankman

Build instructions are below, use the "introMod" folder for... mods. Also, `lime test windows` uses the source assets folder instead of the export one.

## CREDITS
- Credits to Smokey555 for the fancy Animate Atlas code

## HOW TO BUILD
- Install the required libraries as told in the original Funkin' repo (with latest Haxe!)
- Run `update.bat` to install all required additional libraries (flixel fork, hscript fork...)
- Run `lime test windows` to compile the game (may take a long time)
